# suladi-sapta-tala  (or sooLaadi - sapta - TaaLa)

A python tala and jati combiner to randomly display the suladi sapta talas - useful during practise sessions!


# Background and Domain
This is specifically for the students of Carnatic music, who need to prepare for the exam with the ability to recall any combination of *taala and *jaati
I thought, i will use a simple script to act like an examiner, who will RANDOMLY ask for a combination which I will recite.

I will link to Carnatic Music Theory etc ASAP.

# how to use this?
This is a very short python script.. just run it anyway we need.

# What next?
I am hoping to make this a webapp.. so that anyone with access to the web can just go to a page, click a button to get a combination to practice
- perhaps, that page will also let them upload thier practice session which can then be evaluated?
- this is also my opportunity to learn Python, while I learn Carnatic music. #
